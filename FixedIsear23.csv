joy,During my Summer vacations I planned a carnival for the community Ã¡ youth center with a few other volunteers.  I was the head of the Ã¡ organizors and we spent over a month planning it.  During this Ã¡ period we got to know and understood each other.  We Ã¡ discovered each others potential and we planned many interesting Ã¡ things for the carnival.  The day of the carnival everything was Ã¡ bright the programmes went well and the attendants enjoyed it.  Ã¡ I felt extremely excited about it.
anger,I was a prefect at secondary school.  On the sports day I told Ã¡ others that I would take down the names of the people who Ã¡ misbehaved and after some time I sat down for a brief rest.

As a result I had to Ã¡ spend several days in order to get a new one.  I will always Ã¡ remember all the work I had to do and the bad treatment I Ã¡ suffered because of the bureaucratic behaviour of the civil Ã¡ servant.

When I met my classmates and friends I told them the Ã¡ good news.  I was so happy that I could not concentrate on my Ã¡ studies. Ã¡
fear,A boy phoned me at night and wanted to talk to me for 30 minutes Ã¡ outside.  I thought that he would reveal what he felt and would Ã¡ question me on our relationship.

Her arrogant behaviour made me sick and angry.

anger,My friend half-teasingly called me a bad nickname.  I felt Ã¡ insulted and kicked his hip in anger.  I was stable later and did Ã¡ not feel angry at him.  In fact I was afraid that the other Ã¡ friends who were with us would think that I was an intolerant Ã¡ person.  However I could not apologize so I pretended that Ã¡ nothing had happened and smiled when I left.  My friend did not Ã¡ say anything but just watched me leave.
sadness,Last night I did not do very well in one of the subjects.  Before Ã¡ the result was announced I feared that I would fail.  Finally I Ã¡ got a D and as the results of the other subjects were not all      Ã¡ good I felt a little sad.

fear,It was a week before the higher level results were announced.  I Ã¡ had tried and failed many times and this was the last time that Ã¡ I was taking the exam.  I knew that if i failed again I woulld Ã¡ have to enter the society.  I imagined things during this period Ã¡ - I dreamt that I had entered university and it was a nice Ã¡ experience.  When I thought about the future an unexplainable Ã¡ fear rose in me.  I feared being a worker and not having a bright Ã¡ prospect I also feared the criticism of my relatives as my Ã¡ brother had gone to university.  Whenevr I thought of this issue Ã¡ I could not eat or concentrate and my heart beat increased.
anger,The surname of my brother was different from ours.  He often Ã¡ grinned at home and provoked others for the pleasure of it.  This Ã¡ made me angry.

joy,"In August 1983 the long awaited \\big envelope\\"" (a document for Ã¡"
fear,On Christmas eve 1984 I had just finished the exams and was Ã¡ afraid as the results of one of my major subjects had been very Ã¡ unsatisfactory.  I thought that I had only a 50% chance of Ã¡ passing.  Even if I failed this subject I would not need to Ã¡ repeat.  However I liked this subject very much and my results Ã¡ were bad because of my lazyness.  If I was forced to change to a Ã¡ minor in this subject I would be very unwilling.
anger,In September 1984 I was forced to live with someone I did not Ã¡ like.  The first week we were at loggerheads and our conversation Ã¡ was like a debate.  The atmosphere was very bad.  When he learnt Ã¡ that I had got 95 marks in a test he told me \\ A failure You lost Ã¡
sadness,This issue worried me rather than saddening me.  In mid September Ã¡ I went to Guanggho alone.  I was looking for an accomodation in Ã¡ the evening and after having walked 2 or 3 miles I still could not Ã¡ find anything.  What could I do?  I was not worried about Ã¡ sleeping on the streets but because of some procedural problems.  Ã¡ I finally found a place to sleep at 8 o'clock.
joy,I received a letter from a distant friend.
fear,My parents were out and I was the eldest at home.  At midnight a Ã¡ male stranger phoned us and spoke to me in a rough language.  I Ã¡ hung up and heard someone walking outside our door.
anger,Two years back someone invited me to be the tutor of her Ã¡ grand-daughter.  The grand-daughter asked me some questions in Ã¡ mathematics so I taught her.  However she did not listen to me Ã¡ and this made me feel unhappy.  The second year it was the same.  Ã¡ When I entered university the girl's parents suggested that I be Ã¡ employed as their daghters tutor.  They told me that at university  Ã¡ there was no homework and I would have a lot of time so they Ã¡ made a time-table  for me which required me to be the tutor five Ã¡ days a week.  They did not respect me and anyway I had another Ã¡ child to teach.
sadness,I had taken the responsibility to do something and I had Ã¡ prepared for it.  However I failed because of my timidity.  After Ã¡ three attempts I still could not adapt to the atmosphere and Ã¡ failed as before.  I felt imcompetent and felt that the others Ã¡ would think that I had not prepared for it.
