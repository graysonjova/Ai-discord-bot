sadness,There was a conflict of interest between me and a close friend of Ã¡ mine.  He only thought about his own interest and not about our Ã¡ friendship.  This behaviour hurt his friends.  Another incident Ã¡ is when a friend isolated himself without giving any reasons.
joy,When I received the letter informing that I had been accepted to Ã¡ be a Chinese university student I was excited as I had longed Ã¡ for it.
fear,One day when I was a little boy my friends asked me to play Ã¡ with them outside and to catch some boys.  However our parents Ã¡ did not know that we were out and when I got home it was very Ã¡ late and I feared being scolded by my parents.
anger,When I learnt that a friend of mine had talked about me to Ã¡ another friend and had said wrong things about my abilities and Ã¡ attitudes.  I was very angry.
sadness,About two years ago my girlfriend suggested that we separate.  Ã¡ This really gave me a shock as I had never thought that she would Ã¡ say such things.  The reason she gave me was that we were not Ã¡ suited for each other.
joy,During a certain period I felt successful and extremely satisfied.   Ã¡ When I found that any tasks or decisions that I had made were better  Ã¡ than expected.
fear,I am scared when I stroll alone on the Chung Chi college campus.
anger,One day I discussed a very important question with A.  A Ã¡ suddenly declared that he would not accept my position and Ã¡ thought that he himself was right.  Moreover he attacked  Ã¡ strongly not my opinion but me personally.
sadness,When I learnt that I had failed an exam This not only influenced Ã¡ my emotions but also other important tasks it also made my Ã¡ record imperfect.
joy,I felt happy when I received the letter telling me that I had Ã¡ been admitted to the university.
fear,During the first year in university I had bad results in both Ã¡ the terms especially the first term.  I was afraid that  I would Ã¡ not be promoted to the next year and that the others would go Ã¡ ahead of me.
anger,Once my father slapped my mother for a small quarrel.
sadness,A few years ago my mother suffered from canccer and died within Ã¡ two years.  We had not finished our studies then and could not Ã¡ bear our responsibilities as her children.  My mother had tried Ã¡ her best to take care of us but she lived in pain these two Ã¡ years.  Neither the doctor nor we could do anything for her as Ã¡ cancer is incurable.  I was very eager to replace her in Ã¡ suffernig even die instead of her.
joy,One Saturday afternoon I deliberately dressed up nicely (I had Ã¡ been in a bad mood of late).  I hoped to go for a walk in the Ã¡ soft sunlight to try and uplift my spirits.  When I was having Ã¡ lunch in the canteen two of my male classmates asked me as to Ã¡ why I was dressed so nicely (they had seldom joked with me Ã¡ before).  One of them said that he had a lounge suit and we would Ã¡ look very nice if we wore them together.
fear,The exam was drawing near and I wanted to prepare for it.  But I Ã¡ had a lot of other things to do so I did not have much time to prepare  Ã¡ for the exams.  Whenever I sat down to study I was scared that I would  Ã¡ not be able to finish it.
anger,A female classmate was always late for meetings which were for Ã¡ the homework and not social gatherings.  We were very busy and Ã¡ the deadline was close but we had to waste half an hour or an Ã¡ hour waiting for her as we could do nothing else then.
sadness,After a meeting ended we started talking about when we would Ã¡ have the next discussion ( I had many tests the coming week and Ã¡ could not have a meeting in between I thought that they would Ã¡ understand this as they had always done).  They did not Ã¡ understand my problem and thought that I should not have so many Ã¡ other activities.  Their reaction made me burst into tears.
joy,It was the first time I met him (my boyfriend Mr.W).  It was Ã¡ during the first term Summer vacations.  We met each other while Ã¡ handing in our homework.  He invited me have a trip with him and Ã¡ we were together till 8 P.M.
fear,The day the results of the certificate exam came out.  I went to Ã¡ school and at first I did not feel frightened.  By the time I Ã¡ reached the fourth floor ( the results were being given on the Ã¡ fifth floor) I found it difficult to walk and felt that I would Ã¡ die.
anger,One day I had sunned my favourite shirt and was putting it back Ã¡ in the wardrobe when my younger brother snatched it from me and Ã¡ wore it.  He had not had a bath and was very dirty.  I scolded him Ã¡ but he answered back and locked himself up in a room.  I was very Ã¡ angry so I starteed kicking on the door and abusing him loudly Ã¡ and freely.
sadness,When I was a child I was playing on the upper deck of the bed Ã¡ with my brother.  My parents slept on the lower deck.  My father Ã¡ felt disgusted and beat me up.  I felt very sad as my father had Ã¡ never beaten me or scolded me before.
joy,I had gone camping with my old classmates and there was a storm.  Ã¡ We were in a flurry but at that time I felt the love and concern Ã¡ of my friends.
fear,I was on a trip to Phillipines during Summer and I was staying in Ã¡ a hotel.  The room I was staying in was very silent and had very Ã¡ dim lights.  The last night I felt frightened and lay awake - I Ã¡ could hear some sounds around me and dared not open my eyes - I Ã¡ waited for dawn.
anger,I had a very good friend in secondary school.  The year after our Ã¡ graduation I prepared to celebrate her birthday and I called off Ã¡ all my appointments.  I got together the other friends and we Ã¡ were ready to give the entire day to her.  However this friend Ã¡ disappeared on her birthday.  When I phoned another friend I Ã¡ didcovered thay she was busy I did not call her anymore.
sadness,I am a Christian but I cannot find any meaning in life . It Ã¡ seems that I am deceiving myself but I cannot find the way out.
joy,When the result of the certificate exam was announced.  I was Ã¡ surprised and happy as the result was better than I had Ã¡ expected.
fear,When I was young I got lost on the street and the police found me Ã¡ after a day.
anger,My sister once stole my mother's money and made her very angry.  Ã¡ After this my mother would beat her up for unreasonable reasons.  Ã¡ One day my sister lent her book to a friend without telling my Ã¡ mother about it.  When my mother learnt this she beat her up and Ã¡ even threatened her with a pair of scissors.
sadness,My academic result was poor and I had to repeat the second year.  Ã¡ I felt sad about the coming several years.
joy,I was admited to the Chinese university of Hong Kong.  The day Ã¡ the results were announced I looked in the newspaper and saw my Ã¡ candidature number.
fear,One year when I went to a camp I was chased by a dog.  I tried Ã¡ hard and finally managed to escape from it.  My torch suddenly Ã¡ went off and we talked about ghost stories and I thought that Ã¡ there were ghosts.
anger,When I was in F4 I played a basket-ball match against another Ã¡ school's team.  One of their team members kicked a team-mate of Ã¡ mine so I kicked him back and we had a fight with each other.
sadness,I received the mid-term exam paper of one of my major subjects Ã¡ and I found that I had failed it.
joy,When my performance (homework or other work) is better than others.
fear,I found a problem in homework which would not get solved although Ã¡ I tried my best.
anger,I had a date with my girlfriend the time and place had not been Ã¡ fixed.  I asked her to phone me an hour later as it was midnight Ã¡ and I did not want to disturb her family.  I waited several hours Ã¡ for her call she did not call me that night.
sadness,When I found that my ability to do ordinary work was worse than Ã¡ my fellow mates.
joy,During my Summer vacations I planned a carnival for the community Ã¡ youth center with a few other volunteers.  I was the head of the Ã¡ organizors and we spent over a month planning it.  During this Ã¡ period we got to know and understood each other.  We Ã¡ discovered each others potential and we planned many interesting Ã¡ things for the carnival.  The day of the carnival everything was Ã¡ bright the programmes went well and the attendants enjoyed it.  Ã¡ I felt extremely excited about it.
anger,I was a prefect at secondary school.  On the sports day I told Ã¡ others that I would take down the names of the people who Ã¡ misbehaved and after some time I sat down for a brief rest.  Ã¡ Suddenly the head prefect came and scolded me in front of others. Ã¡  I was very angry as there were other prefects sitting and he Ã¡ picked on me.  I thought that a brief rest was not  serious Ã¡ enough to be blamed.
joy,When high level results were declared I found my candidature Ã¡ number.  I was very happy as I had not expected it.  As I had been  Ã¡ injured before the examination and I had performed poorly.
fear,Once when I was ten I could not remember why my mother was so Ã¡ angry.  She fainted suddenly and I was very scared as I did not Ã¡ know what to do .
anger,When I got into a bus I found that my wallet had been stolen. Ã¡ It was not a great loss from the monetary point of view but I Ã¡ lost some documents - identity papers.  As a result I had to Ã¡ spend several days in order to get a new one.  I will always Ã¡ remember all the work I had to do and the bad treatment I Ã¡ suffered because of the bureaucratic behaviour of the civil Ã¡ servant.  I had already had bad luck and they treated me like a Ã¡ criminal.   At one point of time I really wanted to quarrel with Ã¡ them.
sadness,I quarrelled with my younger sister because I had said something Ã¡ against her boyfriend.  Consequently she looked through me when Ã¡ she saw me as she thought that I was trying to separate them.  Ã¡ She had misunderstood me.
joy,"After attending a song contest proposed by a band called \\Chyne\\"" Ã¡"
fear,At noon one Sunday I received a phone call telling me that my Ã¡ mother had been knocked down by a car at the street crossing and Ã¡ that her husband should go and see her.  I could not believe this Ã¡ as my father and my mother had gone out together to buy lunch Ã¡ boxes.  However I immediately ran to the scene of the accident.
anger,The day the results of the Chinese university was announced I Ã¡ should have been very happy; however my grandmother because of  Ã¡ her prejudice and misunderstanding started a  quarrel with my Ã¡ mother.  She expected me to take her side and she deliberately Ã¡ talked of my mother's wrong doings.  I was very angry because - Ã¡ one my grandmother was not being reasonable and two because it Ã¡ should have been a happy day and three we had moved into a new Ã¡ house that day.
sadness,When I was in lower six class during the Summer I joined a Ã¡ research group of the Chinese university student union.  I knew Ã¡ a lot of CV students there.  A year later one of them was Ã¡ travelling in mainland China and he got T.B.  He died a few weeks Ã¡ after coming back to H.K.  We all got together for the funeral Ã¡ and when I looked at the body for the last time I felt extremely Ã¡ sad.
joy,When I received the result slip of the higher level examination Ã¡ (an university entrance exam) and saw that I had a very good Ã¡ possibility of being accepted into the university I felt very Ã¡ excited.
fear,One camping night I listened to the ghost stories told by my Ã¡ classmates.
anger,Last week I had planned to play tennis and had booked a tennis Ã¡ court.   However when I arrived at the university gym the clerk Ã¡ told me that the court was being used for lessons.
sadness,When I was ill and had to stay at the hospital for a period of Ã¡ time.
joy,"I had a dream : I had a very close friend who had several stone Ã¡ houses in the New Territories (villages) but they did not have Ã¡ much furniture.  He took me to see his fields (I had never seen Ã¡ them before) and there were several inches of clear water on Ã¡ which the sunshine was reflected.  I wanted to sit among the Ã¡ short green plants in the fields but was afraid of treading the Ã¡ plants to death.  My friend said \\They will not die\\"" and I sat Ã¡"
fear,After seeing a horror film - Omen.  I could not sleep at night  Ã¡ even though I closed my eyes.  The last scene of the film kept Ã¡ coming back to me I seemed to hear the girls in the film Ã¡ shouting at the devil.  The devil did not have any expression on Ã¡ his face and I thought that he would choose me.
anger,My friend often played a joke on me and sometimes I thought that Ã¡ he was a nonsensical person. Once when we went to a friend's Ã¡ house he walked in first and shut the door firmly behind him.  I Ã¡ felt that he did not respect me and moreover I was his friend so Ã¡ he should not have behaved like that.  I was very angry (as it is Ã¡ I was in a bad mood then).
sadness,I suddenly found that those whom I considerered to be my good Ã¡ friends did not care for me.  Although I could still be with them Ã¡ I felt unimportant.  I deeply thought about the reason behind Ã¡ this so as to see who was responsible for this.  Finally I made Ã¡ up my mind and decided not to expect too much from them.  I was Ã¡ sad when I decided that they were no longer my good friends.
joy,During the exam period I studied in the library alone.  A close   Ã¡ friend of mine who is also a classmate told me that my Ã¡ application for a Japanese inter-cultural exchange programme had Ã¡ been accepted.  I was not very sure as I did not know that the Ã¡ list had been declared.  I ran to the board and saw that I was Ã¡ really included in the list.  I was so excited that I smiled all Ã¡ day long.  When I met my classmates and friends I told them the Ã¡ good news.  I was so happy that I could not concentrate on my Ã¡ studies. Ã¡
fear,A boy phoned me at night and wanted to talk to me for 30 minutes Ã¡ outside.  I thought that he would reveal what he felt and would Ã¡ question me on our relationship.  I treated him as a friend and Ã¡ did not want any misunderstandings.  Therefore I refused to meet Ã¡ him and told him that I would see him the coming day.  I was very Ã¡ unhappy as I feared having hurt him and got him into trouble.
anger,We had fixed time for practice as we had to participate in the Ã¡ inter-department song contest.  I arrived and found that there Ã¡ was nobody there.  When I went to the canteen I found them eating Ã¡ lunch.  I was so angry that I aired my greviances to one of them Ã¡ and then left.
sadness,A friend told me that he had suffered in love and in academics.  Ã¡ I shared his sadness.
joy,That afternoon I rushed home to look at the result slip of the Ã¡ higher level as fast as possible.  I opened the envelope very Ã¡ carefully and found that my results were much better than I Ã¡ had expected and thus I could enter the Chinese university.  My Ã¡ diligence had paid and I was very happy.
fear,When I was young I had gone to an old lift and played with the Ã¡ antique lift.  The guy discovered me and warned me I was very Ã¡ frightened.
anger,Whenever my father smokes the smell makes me feel very Ã¡ uncomfortable.  He never listens to my complaints and I curse him Ã¡ furiously in my mind.  I cannot solve this problem by violence Ã¡ because of traditional moral values.
sadness,My got my mathematics test's marks and could not believe that it Ã¡ was true.  In the past I would have at least 80% marks.  Was I Ã¡ getting weaker at studies ?  This made me feel that I should not Ã¡ expect too much from going to the university.
joy,One night my boyfriend expressed his love for me in the canteen in Ã¡ the presence of my friends by giving me a present.
fear,After listening to ghost stories with my classmates I had to back Ã¡ alone to the hostel at night.  I had to walk through a long and Ã¡ quiet road and I was scared of meeting a ghost.
anger,I came across a girl at the school bus-stop I had seen her Ã¡ several friends as she was a friend's friend.  However my friend Ã¡ had never introduced me to her and when she got off the bus I Ã¡ smiled at her but she did not respond pretending not to have seen Ã¡ me.  Her arrogant behaviour made me sick and angry.
sadness,My examination results were not satisfactory even though I had Ã¡ tried my best.  Then I started wondering about my abilities for Ã¡ the major subject.  However I did not know how to choose my major Ã¡ subject if I were to change it.
joy,When two female classmates and I were having lunch we chatted and  Ã¡ cracked jokes I was very happy.  However I felt that I may have  Ã¡ said something inappropriate which might cause them to have a bad  Ã¡ impression of me.
fear,I did not do well in one of the subjects last term.   I was Ã¡ afraid that I would fail.  My result was a grade D though it was Ã¡ not good I still passed.  I felt more comfortable then.
anger,My friend half-teasingly called me a bad nickname.  I felt Ã¡ insulted and kicked his hip in anger.  I was stable later and did Ã¡ not feel angry at him.  In fact I was afraid that the other Ã¡ friends who were with us would think that I was an intolerant Ã¡ person.  However I could not apologize so I pretended that Ã¡ nothing had happened and smiled when I left.  My friend did not Ã¡ say anything but just watched me leave.
sadness,Last night I did not do very well in one of the subjects.  Before Ã¡ the result was announced I feared that I would fail.  Finally I Ã¡ got a D and as the results of the other subjects were not all      Ã¡ good I felt a little sad.
joy,When I received a letter from the university telling me that my Ã¡ application had been accepted.
fear,At primary school the teacher caught me cheating during a Ã¡ dictation.
anger,Someone spread rumours about me.
sadness,One night my father suddenly suffered from a heart attack which Ã¡ lead to breathing difficulties.
joy,I had a picnic with old classmates we chatted and played games.
fear,At night when I was alone at home (all t
sadness,sadhe family members usually Ã¡ get together at that time) someone knocked vigorously on the Ã¡ door.
anger,When I saw that my bed at the hostel was a mess I guessed that Ã¡ someone else had used my daily necessities.  I felt that my  personal Ã¡ sanity had been affected.
sadness,During the Physics experiment session I did not understand the Ã¡ content of the experiment and did not know how to do it.
joy,It was the first time that I gave a birthday present to my friend. Ã¡   She wrote me a letter as she is my girlfriend.  The content of Ã¡ the letter was so sweet that it made me feel very happy.Ã¡
fear,It was a week before the higher level results were announced.  I Ã¡ had tried and failed many times and this was the last time that Ã¡ I was taking the exam.  I knew that if i failed again I woulld Ã¡ have to enter the society.  I imagined things during this period Ã¡ - I dreamt that I had entered university and it was a nice Ã¡ experience.  When I thought about the future an unexplainable Ã¡ fear rose in me.  I feared being a worker and not having a bright Ã¡ prospect I also feared the criticism of my relatives as my Ã¡ brother had gone to university.  Whenevr I thought of this issue Ã¡ I could not eat or concentrate and my heart beat increased.
anger,The surname of my brother was different from ours.  He often Ã¡ grinned at home and provoked others for the pleasure of it.  This Ã¡ made me angry.
sadness,When I was in primary 6 my father died.  I was very young then Ã¡ and did not know what had happened.  The weeping of my relatives Ã¡ and my tears made me sad.
joy,"In August 1983 the long awaited \\big envelope\\"" (a document for Ã¡"
fear,On Christmas eve 1984 I had just finished the exams and was Ã¡ afraid as the results of one of my major subjects had been very Ã¡ unsatisfactory.  I thought that I had only a 50% chance of Ã¡ passing.  Even if I failed this subject I would not need to Ã¡ repeat.  However I liked this subject very much and my results Ã¡ were bad because of my lazyness.  If I was forced to change to a Ã¡ minor in this subject I would be very unwilling.
anger,In September 1984 I was forced to live with someone I did not Ã¡ like.  The first week we were at loggerheads and our conversation Ã¡ was like a debate.  The atmosphere was very bad.  When he learnt Ã¡ that I had got 95 marks in a test he told me \\ A failure You lost Ã¡
sadness,This issue worried me rather than saddening me.  In mid September Ã¡ I went to Guanggho alone.  I was looking for an accomodation in Ã¡ the evening and after having walked 2 or 3 miles I still could not Ã¡ find anything.  What could I do?  I was not worried about Ã¡ sleeping on the streets but because of some procedural problems.  Ã¡ I finally found a place to sleep at 8 o'clock.
joy,I received a letter from a distant friend.
fear,My parents were out and I was the eldest at home.  At midnight a Ã¡ male stranger phoned us and spoke to me in a rough language.  I Ã¡ hung up and heard someone walking outside our door.
anger,Two years back someone invited me to be the tutor of her Ã¡ grand-daughter.  The grand-daughter asked me some questions in Ã¡ mathematics so I taught her.  However she did not listen to me Ã¡ and this made me feel unhappy.  The second year it was the same.  Ã¡ When I entered university the girl's parents suggested that I be Ã¡ employed as their daghters tutor.  They told me that at university  Ã¡ there was no homework and I would have a lot of time so they Ã¡ made a time-table  for me which required me to be the tutor five Ã¡ days a week.  They did not respect me and anyway I had another Ã¡ child to teach.
sadness,I had taken the responsibility to do something and I had Ã¡ prepared for it.  However I failed because of my timidity.  After Ã¡ three attempts I still could not adapt to the atmosphere and Ã¡ failed as before.  I felt imcompetent and felt that the others Ã¡ would think that I had not prepared for it.
